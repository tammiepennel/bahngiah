                            <p> I've made a excel file that works as an experience calculator for safe rooms and new characters in Sword of the Stars: The Pit, it might be useful and I haven't found anywhere to post it sincerely. If any of you can link it or do something with it useful, please do, I'm giving it to help anyone in that particular game as I've tried to make it as exhaustive as possible. amp#x200B; The link: https://1drv.ms/x/s!AgmXpLmulkGTkTqum9IGc\_0CIzDz (https://1drv.ms/x/s!AgmXpLmulkGTkTqum9IGc_0CIzDz). I've tried to get into this game several times before. I love the races and all the world building Kerberos made for the SotS universe, but there are some things about the game that bother me; namely, the ones in the topic title. It's been a while since I last played, and my PC was much inferior then, but I remember loading times being atrocious, especially in the late game. Is there any setting or tweak to remedy this? The other thing I dislike about the game is that the strategical ( amp#x200B; I stumbled upon the below announcement today in /r/sots by /u/willdieh https://www.reddit.com/r/sots/comments/axckco/sots2\_fan\_patch\_released/ (https://www.reddit.com/r/sots/comments/axckco/sots2_fan_patch_released/) amp#x200B; I haven't got to try it out yet, but hope to this weekend. Kind of excited to have a reason. 
I've had this game on my wishlist for years now, but every single time I go buy it, I remember the tons of people saying how the game is the most frustrating thing they've ever played and that the game is awful. Should I understand that crafting is a feature and mechanic of those games, but I just can't stand the way they have been implemented in these specific games, which ruins the experience that I would like to have with them. Can they be played successfully and beaten ignoring the crafting mechanics completely? Thanks. I have the SotS - The Pit, and have enjoyed on-and-off. There's a sale going on at GOG.com right now, and I was wondering if any of the DLCs are worth getting. Can any owners give their opinions? Cheers. 
I backed this for a dollar as someone semi-interested in it and I have to say it seems like I've seen nothing on BGG or the likes about it? I tried to play the TTS demo but the rulebook was very badly written and the module poorly made. I guess now I'm wondering what people think? It obviously succeeded on KS so I'm assuming it has some redeeming qualities but I'm struggling to see them. Was there some later rules that make more sense? Or does gaming discussion happen elsewhere. You can find it at bundlestars.com in a super bundle. If you were on the fence, now is a great time to pull the trigger.
